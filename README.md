Line function calculator created with Flutter.

## Features
User can draw a freehand line on the two-dimensional coordinate plane

Tool calculates function values along the line and visualizes them

When a mouse pointer is hovered on the freehand line, the formulas' values are shown as a pop-up​

Tool includes a graph of all the functions (x-axis: distance along the line, y-axis: function value)​

When a mouse pointer is hovered on the freehand line, the location is indicated in the function graph​

Whenever the functions' graphs cross each other in the graph, the corresponding point is indicated on the freehand line​

Tool can save and load projects in .json format


### Functions
addition

substraction

multiplication

division

### Variables
LDB = distance along the line from the beginning of the line​

LDE = distance along the line from the end of the line​

BLDB = beeline distance from the beginning of the line​

BLDE = beeline distance from the end of the line​

## Installation
